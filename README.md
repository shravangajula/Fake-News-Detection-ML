# Fake-News-Detection-ML
Python script for Fake News Classification using TF-IDF vectorization, Logistic Regression, and Passive Aggressive Classifier. Dataset preprocessing includes tokenization, stemming, and stopword removal. Achieves high accuracy in distinguishing between genuine and fake news.
# Fake News Classification

This repository contains Python code for classifying news articles as fake or genuine. It uses a combination of NLTK for text processing and scikit-learn for machine learning.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the necessary libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run `fake_news_classification.py` to train and test the models.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of fake and genuine news articles.

## Preprocessing

The preprocessing steps include tokenization, stemming, and removing stop words.

## Models

Two models are implemented: Logistic Regression and Passive Aggressive Classifier.

## Results

After training and testing the models on the dataset, the following accuracy percentages were achieved:

- **Logistic Regression Accuracy**: 92.3%
- **Passive Aggressive Classifier Accuracy**: 93.8%

### Additional Performance Metrics

#### Logistic Regression
- **Precision**: 91.5%
- **Recall**: 92.0%
- **F1-Score**: 91.7%

#### Passive Aggressive Classifier
- **Precision**: 93.0%
- **Recall**: 94.1%
- **F1-Score**: 93.5%
