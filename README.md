# Fake-News-Detection-ML
This project detects fake news using Python and machine learning. It preprocesses a dataset of news articles from Kaggle with stemming, stop words removal, and tokenization. The data is split into training and testing sets, and a logistic regression model is built using NumPy and Pandas in Jupyter Notebook. Visualizations are created with Power BI.
